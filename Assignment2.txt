Name node
1)stores metadata for HDFS
2)Whenever a file is placed in the cluster a corresponding entry of it location is maintained by the NameNode
3)Automated Failover : pro-actively detects NameNode host and process failures and will automatically switch to the standby NameNode to maintain availability for the HDFS service.
4)Full Stack Resiliency: made in such a way to avoid losing data.
5)
Data node
1)stores actual data in HDFS
2)For high availability due to replication
3)It sends information to the NameNode about the files and blocks stored in that node
4)Respond to namenode for filesystem opertions
5)

Resource Manager
1)allocate CPU,memory for container--tracking resoucres 
2)scheduling the jobs
3)ApplicationMasters are responsible for negotiating resources with the ResourceManager
4)NodeManagers take instructions from the ResourceManager and manage resources available on a single node.
5)

Node manager 
1)keep node manager up to date with resource manager
2)Oversee life cycle management
3)monitoring resource usage (memory, CPU) of individual containers
4)logâ€™s management 
5)tracking node-health
